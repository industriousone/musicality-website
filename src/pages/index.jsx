				<p>
					Musicality is a nights-and-weekends passion project for
					me&mdash;I&apos;d love to do it full time, but that&apos;s not quite a
					reality yet.

				<p>
					I fell behind the recent flurry of changes to macOS, tvOS, and the music
					services, and the{' '}
					<Link to="/help">list of known issues</Link> got away from
					me. I wasn&apos;t feeling good about the state of things, so I decided
					to stop offering Musicality for sale until I could get things working to
					my satisfaction again.
				</p>

				<p>
					The good news:{' '}
					<em>I&apos;m really close to having everything working again.</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you would like to try things out for yourself, there is a{' '}
					<Link to="/download">free trial available</Link>...just be sure to check
					the <Link to="/help">known issues</Link> first! If you
					purchased Musicality already, and just need to download the latest
					version, you can <Link to="/download">find it here</Link>.
